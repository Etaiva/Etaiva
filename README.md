My name is Etienne Pretorius. 
You can find me on my LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/etienne-pretorius/
This profile serves as a repository for my learning curve in terms of data, be that data analysis or data science. 
I am self taught in terms of data, but have a resume in terms of business analysis and business management.
