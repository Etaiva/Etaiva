### My name is Etienne
You can contact me on my LinkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/etienne-pretorius/

I am developing my knowledge base from an advanced skillset in Microsoft Excel into functional data analysis by learning SQL and R.
I have many years experience using advanced Excel. I have a resume of business experience and degrees (Masters) which serve to understand the data, explain it, and visualise it for the client.
I am interested in collaborating, acquiring opensource data bases, and in return sharing my knowledge of business and freelancing.
